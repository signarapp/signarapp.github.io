        <h2>The Future of Sign Language Education</h2>
        
        <p>Signar is an Augmented Reality iOS app for kids aged 6-16 to help them communicate with the deaf community, and challenging them to learn British Sign Language with some surprises along the way.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #f19034;">What is Signar?</h1>
        <p>Signar bridges the gap between the Hearing and Deaf communities by allowing children aged 6 to 16 to communicate easily. Signar uses Augmented Reality technology to give kids their own 2D virtual interpreter who will be with them every step of the way; whether they're hearing, suffering from hearing loss or are profoundly Deaf, their interpreter will analyse the conversation and translate it in real-time. </p>
        
        <p>At Signar, we believe learning Sign Language is vital to promote an inclusive society, and it all starts with kids. Everyday Deaf children are segregated and discriminated against simply because we cannot communicate with them easily. Signar aims to change that. Alongside real-time translation, kids can take lessons in basic BSL topics which will provide a foundation for having a conversation in BSL. Lessons include the Alphabet, Numbers, Family, School and Foods. </p>

        <p>We want your kids to be involved from the get go, so we've tailored the sign up experience to provide clear instructions and animated cues so they can create their own account and personalise their character.</p>
        
        <p>Don't worry! You can make changes to these details in the dedicated Parent's Dashboard section, if need be.</p>

        <p>Signar has a password protected area for you to check up on your kids' learning progress. From the Parents' Dashboard you can see when they were last active, how many lessons each user has completed and what lesson they're currently on, to make sure they stay on track. We've also hidden the lesson store in this area so you have full control over what your kids are learning. </p>
        
        <p>Other features in the Parents' Dashboard include user settings, lesson progress and personalised notifications.</p>
